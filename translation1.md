Chaos was the first God. Her daughter, Nox and the Goddess Earth, was the mother of all men. This was the mother of the God of death and destruction. Their sons were horrible monsters: Typhon, Python, and Cyclopes. Typhon and Python were huge serpents and Cyclopes an oafish stoneworker. But his brother was Uranus, the very first king of Gods.
