Long ago, Prometheus, the first son of Iapetus, was fashioned from mud. At the same time, Vulcan fashioned woman from mud.

Minerva and the god of all gifts gave a soul to the woman. **There are two verbs and two complete sentences here in Latin.**

The name "Pandora" is given to her. **To translate the *perfect* tense, we should say "*was* given" (as you do in the next sentence).**
Pandora was given marriage to Epimetheus from Jupiter. Their daughter was Pyrrha, the first mortal.
