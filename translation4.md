He could not capture Troy in ten years with the greeks, so Epeus made a surprisingly large wooden
horse. For this, those gathered are Menelaus, Ulixes, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas,
Thoas, Machaon, Neoptolemus. On the horse they wrote, “the greeks give a gift to Minerva”
and moved their camps to Tenedo. When the Trojans saw it, they judged that the enemy had gone away; Priamus
ordered the horse to be led into the temple of Minervae. The prophet Cassandra said the horse
has enemies within, have faith in her abilites, the horse should not be put in temple. The Greeks
exited through the door, killed the guards and conquered Troy.
