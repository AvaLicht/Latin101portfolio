Erectheus, brother of Pandion, had 4 sisters. At the time, Eumolpus, brother of Neptune, came to attack Athens, and he was vicorious. Neptune, angry because his brother was killed, said "the sitster of Erechtheus must be sacrificed". Therefore, Chthonia, sister of una, was sacrificed. He himself killed the other sister. Erectheus was struck by the very lightning.
