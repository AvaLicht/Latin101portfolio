Erectheus, son of Pandion, had 4 daughters. At the time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but he was killed. Neptune, angry because his son was killed, said "the daughter of Erechtheus must be sacrificed".
Therefore, Chthonia, one of the daughters, was sacrificed. The other daughters killed themselves.
Erectheus himself was struck by lightning.
