**Needs revision**

**Review formation of the perfect passive.  Remember that those forms are compounds combining the verb "to be" with the fourth principle part.**


*Erechtheus*, Pandīonis fīlius, **habuit** fīliās quattuor. illō tempōre, *Eumolpus*, Neptūnī fīlius, **vēnit** ad Athēnās oppugnandās, sed hic **victus est**. *Neptūnus*, infestus quod fīlius ab Erechtheō **interfectus est**, **dīxit** “Erecthei fīlia immolanda est." itaque Chthonia, fīliārum ūna, immolāta **est**. ceterae sorōrēs sē **interfēcērunt**; ipse *Erechtheus* ab fulmine ictus **est**. 




1. ablative because it is expressing time at a specific moment
2. gerundive
3. to attack athens
4. gerundive so 3rd, Singular, , Perfect, Passive
5. Passive construction, so it expresses that the daughter of Erechtheus was sacrificed but also with a neccescity to mean "must be sacrificed".  **It *does* have a passive sense.  Can you describe more closely what this combination of gerundive + "to be" expresses?**
6. Feminine, dative, singular **But *ceterae* cannot be accusative. So what could this be?** I'm thinking that because the se is plural this is the plural and feminine so then ceterae would have to be nominative? 
7. By means of construction so Prep. + abl

Erectheus, son of Pandion, had 4 daughters. At the time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but he was killed. Neptune, angry because his son was killed, said "the daughter of Erechtheus must be sacrificed".
Therefore, Chthonia, daughter of una, was sacrificed.  **What case is *unarum*?**
He himself killed the other daughter. **Find the subject of the verb *interfecerunt*.**
Erectheus was struck by the very lightning. **What noun does *ipse* describe?**
