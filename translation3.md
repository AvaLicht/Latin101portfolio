Erectheus, son of Pandion, had 4 daughters. At the time, Eumolpus, son of Neptune, came to attack Athens, but he was killed. Neptune, angry because his son was killed, said "the daughter of Erechtheus must be sacrificed". Therefore, Chthonia, daughter of una, was sacrificed. He himself killed the other daughter. Erectheus was struck by the very lightning.
